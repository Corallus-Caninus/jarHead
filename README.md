## Project Objectives ##
- Investigate and apply the NEAT algorithm within the SSCAIT platform.
[SSCAIT] (https://sscaitournament.com/)

- Achieve better understanding of Machine Learning methods outside of backpropagation. [complete] 

- Develop a more universal machine learning algorithm with less hyperparameter tuning. [WIP]

- Research and develop artificial neural networks with genetic algorithms using purely stochastic methods. [Scheduled]
