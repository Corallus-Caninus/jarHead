**Deprecated and Broken**

The jarHead project (including RoM/PoM) has been halted. several working version including a pure NEAT implementation can be found within the revision control but this is not recommended due to disorganization. Changes will not be made for the foreseable future. 

Please see my repo *PointsOfMutation* for a python implementation that will continue the RoM and PoM fitness landscape mapping research discovered here.

## The jarHead project is largely based on HydroNEAT ##

## Project Objectives ##
- Investigate and apply the NEAT algorithm within the SSCAIT platform.

- Achieve better understanding of Machine Learning methods outside of backpropagation and learn Java. [complete] 

- Develop a more universal machine learning algorithm with less hyperparameter tuning. [WIP]

- Research and develop artificial neural networks with genetic algorithms using purely stochastic methods.
